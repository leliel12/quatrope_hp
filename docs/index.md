## [Astroalign](https://astroalign.readthedocs.io)

Astroalign is a python module that will try to align two stellar astronomical images, especially when there is no WCS information available.

It does so by finding similar 3-point asterisms (triangles) in both images and deducing the affine transformation between them.
